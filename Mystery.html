<h1>What ?</h1>
<p>Self improvement is the study and practice of improving one’s life, especially our career, education, relationships, health, happiness, productivity, spirituality, and other personal goals. Common aspects of self improvement include <b>goal setting</b>, <b>motivation</b>, <b>changing habits</b>, <b>improving awareness</b>, <b>identifying one’s values and beliefs</b>, and <b>self-actualization</b>.<br>
Self improvement has a rich history that includes influences from Ancient Greek philosophy, Eastern and Western religions, Existentialism, Psychoanalysis, Hypnotherapy, Gestalt Therapy, and Humanistic Psychology.<br>
Today many concepts and theories in self improvement have begun to be tested scientifically in domains of <b>Clinical Psychology</b> (especially therapies like Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy), as well as research in <b>Positive Psychology</b>, <b>Cognitive Psychology</b>, and <b>Neuroscience</b>.<br>
Self improvement has never been more alive than today. Ever since humans first became conscious they have been in pursuit of happiness and satisfaction. And throughout our written history we have learned a lot about different ways we can improve our lives. Now equipped with the science of modern psychology, humans have more resources and information available than ever before on how to live a better life.<br>
But even with all this great information, many are probably confused on where they should get started. That is a big reason why I write on this blog. I want to filter out the ideas that are no longer relevant and highlight the ones that have persisted and proven to be effective. <br>

<h1>Why ?</h1>
<p>Introduction to self improvement is necessary for people to get out of a <b>life of despair</b> and <b>change his or her lifestyle</b> so that a person is <b>happy and content</b> with himself. It tries to help man develop his own personality and his mind in a manner which is fruitful to his health. It does not seek to end pain or fear in our lives. All these factors are necessary elements in shaping our lives. Rather this helps us use these as stepping stones to developing our life. It is always said that if one wants to create a <b>perfect personality</b> and a <b>cheerful mind</b> one must put himself through various challenging emotional and physical problems, which help create appreciation of the smaller things in life, things which can bring us eternal joy.</p>
<h1>Where ?</h1>
<p>Motivation for self -improvement comes from you.
<em>"If you have self-correction attitude definitely you will learn from your mistakes."</em>
In short, for having self-improvement nature you must always have <b>thirst of learning.</b>
Self-love or when self-loathing gets to the point where we can’t stand ourselves. Self-improvement can come from the smallest amount of self-love. It can come from various reasons.</p>
<h1>When ?</h2>
<p>Is there something in your life that you want to improve?  What better time to start a change in your life than now?!  <b>September is National Self-Improvement Month!</b>  Usually there is a list of things people want to change about their lives.  Many items on that list are often things over which we have no control.  Stop dwelling on them and focus on what you can change - <b>You!</b>
Stop and think - really think - what in your life do you have control over that you want to change?  Perhaps it is your everyday attitude.  An <b>anger problem.  Time management.  Learning</b> to say no.  <b>Caring</b> more about others.  Developing a deeper relationship with God.  What ever it is, make the decision that this month - September - you are going to actively work at changing everyday!</p>
<h1>Who ?</h1>
<p>Countries all across the planet have created this huge self-improvement movement in the last few decades. It’s at an all-time high.
There’s one challenge though everybody:
<em>“If we all try to improve ourselves and not each other, we’re screwed.”</em>
That’s why we need more <b>creators.</b>
Self-improvement is meaningless if you don’t create something that’s designed to help somebody other than yourself.</p>
<h1>How ?</h1>
<p><ul><li><b>Make a date. Right now:</b> The only way to get started is to take action, right now. Not tomorrow, not later today, not in an hour, not when you finish reading this article. Right now!</li>
<li><b>Set a small, achievable goal:</b> Don’t start out trying to conquer the world. Just conquer something exceedingly small.</li>
<li><b>Commit thyself, big time:</b> Make a commitment. It’s this commitment that will keep you going after you overcome inertia.</li>
<li><b>Baby steps, baby:</b> One small step at a time. Don’t try to bite off too much.</li>  
<li><b>Hold thyself accountable:</b> You’ve committed yourself publicly … but it’s not enough to tell people your goal. You have to make it clear that they must hold you accountable to reporting to them your progress.</li>
<li><b>Motivate yourself:</b>  Find a few different ways to motivate yourself — the more the better. Incorporate these into your plan. Tell people about them. Let them help push you along.</li>
<li><b>Just keep doing it, no matter what:</b> You’ll encounter obstacles, and falter and fall. Just get up and keep going. You’ll face temptations and give in. That’s OK. Just keep going.</li></ul></p>
